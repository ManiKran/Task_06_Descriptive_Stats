🎙️ Research Task 6: Deep Fake Interview
📌 Project Title
Task_06_Deep_Fake

Objective
The goal of this research task was to explore the creative and technical boundaries of large language models (LLMs) by generating a deep fake sports interview using real performance statistics. This builds upon Research Task 5, which involved descriptive statistics of the 2025 Syracuse University Women’s Lacrosse team.

Scope
This task focused on:

Converting sports performance metrics into human-readable narratives
Simulating a realistic post-season interview
Exploring audio or video deep fake generation
Applying prompt engineering to structure narrative tone, dialogue flow, and role-specific responses
Documenting the process and challenges, even if the media generation was only partially successful
💡 Process Overview
Data Ingestion & Stats Summary
Extracted player-level stats from PDF → structured into a CSV → LLM-verified summaries.

Narrative Prompting
Used prompt engineering to:

Simulate quotes from top-performing players (e.g., Emma Ward)
Generate reflective coaching statements
Create a full ESPN-style interview script
Script Finalization
Script is saved in script.md and formatted for either voice-over or avatar-based delivery.

Optional Tools for Deep Fake
Suggested tools (used or explored):

🎤 ElevenLabs – Voice cloning
📹 D-ID – Talking head avatars
📼 Synthesia – AI presenter videos
🧠 Play.ht – Natural-sounding narration
Prompt Logging
The full list of prompts, iterations, and logic is provided in [prompts.md]
